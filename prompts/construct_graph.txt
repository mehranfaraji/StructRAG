Instruction:
Extract the required triplets from Raw Content according to the requirements described in the Requirement
The output of a triplet is in the format of {{'head ':'... ',' relation ':'... ',' tail ': [...', '...']}}.
Note that not all triples in the text need to be extracted. You need to analyze the relationships and entities mentioned in the Requirement and only extract the relevant triples
Note that the head and tail you output should be kept as complete as possible. They may not be just a word or phrase, but can also be a sentence or a paragraph of text. Try to be consistent with the original text and do not make any abbreviations.

Output:
Among the paper titles that need to be considered, "Generative AI and Large Language Models for Cyber Security: All Insights You Need" is the title of the given document, so it should be used as the head. Among the other paper titles that need to be considered, "Llm4vuln: A unified evaluation framework for decoupling and enhancing llms \'vulnerability reasoning" appears in the reference of the given document, so it should be used as the tail. The remaining paper titles that need to be considered do not appear in the given document, so they are not considered.

#### Absract
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for many downstream tasks, including those requiring humanlevel intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent attempts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection are still preliminary, as they lack an in-depth understanding of a subject LLM\'s vulnerability reasoning capability - whether it originates from the model itself or from external assistance, such as invoking tool support and retrieving vulnerability knowledge.
